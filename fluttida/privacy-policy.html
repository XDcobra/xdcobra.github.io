    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 27 December 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Controller</h2>
    <p>
        The controller responsible for data processing in connection with this app is:<br>
        <strong>Felix Krebs</strong><br>
        Rotweg 38, 71686 Remseck am Neckar<br>
        Email: <a href="mailto:xdcobra11@gmail.com">xdcobra11@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Fluttida is a developer tool app for testing different network stacks and SSL pinning configurations.
        You can use Fluttida without registration and without creating a user account.
        This privacy policy explains which data is processed when you use the app and for which purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data collection and processing</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Data processed locally by the app</h3>
    <p>
        The app stores the following information exclusively on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SSL pinning configurations:</strong> Your saved pinning settings are stored only locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Preferences and configurations for network tests (e.g. selected stacks, target URLs, header configurations).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These locally stored data are not accessed by us as the provider and are not transmitted to our own servers.
        We only process personal data if you contact us directly, for example via email.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Advertising via Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>
        This app uses Google AdMob to display ads.
        For users in the EEA/UK/CH, the service is provided by Google Ireland Limited; in other regions, it may be provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Data that may be processed by Google AdMob in particular include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID of your device (e.g. Android Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Device information (device type, operating system version, language settings)</li>
        <li>App usage data (e.g. which ads are shown or clicked)</li>
        <li>Approximate location data (e.g. derived from the IP address), where applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Purposes of processing by AdMob:</strong> Serving and measuring ads, reach measurement, fraud prevention,
        improving the services and – where applicable – serving personalised ads based on your usage and interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Where required (in particular for users in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland),
        we obtain your consent before using personalised advertising.
        In those cases, processing is based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
        In other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in financing and operating the app through advertising (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
        For users in the EEA/UK/CH, consents are obtained in accordance with Google’s EU User Consent Policy via an appropriate consent framework
        (e.g. Google User Messaging Platform / UMP SDK or a compatible Consent Management Platform).
        If you do not give consent to personalised ads, only non-personalised ads are shown or ads are suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Google privacy information:</strong><br>
        Further information on how Google processes data in connection with AdMob can be found at:<br>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a><br>
        Information on how Google uses data from apps and websites that use Google services can be found at:<br>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Opt-out from personalised ads:</strong><br>
        You can disable personalised advertising, for example in the Android settings, such as:<br>
        <em>Settings → Google → Ads → “Opt out of personalised advertising”</em> (labels may differ depending on the Android version).
        You can also reset your advertising ID in your device settings.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Network requests and target servers</h3>
    <p>
        The app sends HTTP(S) requests to URLs that you enter or select in order to test different network stacks and compare their behaviour.
        The content, destination and frequency of these requests are determined solely by you as the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        The resulting request and response data (including headers and response bodies) are processed only on your device,
        for example to display results and logs within the app.
        These data are not stored or logged on our own servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that the privacy policies of the respective providers apply to the target servers you choose (e.g. APIs, websites, your own test systems).
        You are responsible for ensuring that you do not send unlawful or sensitive personal data to third-party servers.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires the following permissions in particular:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet access:</strong> To perform network tests, fetch content and serve ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Network status:</strong> To check whether a network connection is available and which type of connection is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        No additional “dangerous” Android permissions (such as access to contacts, camera, microphone or device storage) are used,
        unless explicitly stated in a future version of the app.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Disclosure of data to third parties</h2>
    <p>
        We only disclose your personal data in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> As described above, certain data are transmitted to Google in order to serve and measure advertising.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legal obligations:</strong> Where we are legally obliged to do so, we may disclose data to authorities or other third parties,
            for example in the context of statutory disclosure obligations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Storage periods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Local app data:</strong> Local configurations, saved requests, results and settings are stored only on your device
            until you delete them within the app or uninstall the app.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data processed by AdMob / Google:</strong> The storage periods for data processed by Google are determined by Google’s policies.
            You can find details in Google’s privacy policy (see link above).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Communication via email:</strong> If you contact us by email, we store your request and the contact details you provide
            for as long as necessary to handle your request and as required by statutory retention obligations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights under the GDPR with regard to your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of access</strong> (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong> (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure</strong> (Art. 17 GDPR)</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong> (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>
        <li><strong>Right to object</strong> to certain processing (Art. 21 GDPR)</li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> (Art. 20 GDPR)</li>
        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint</strong> with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To exercise your rights with respect to processing carried out by us, you can contact us at any time using the email address above.
        You may also exercise your rights regarding data processed by Google AdMob directly vis-à-vis Google.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data security</h2>
    <p>
        We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your data against loss, misuse and unauthorised access.
        This includes, in particular, limiting our own data processing to what is necessary and restricting access to any administrative interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app itself uses the network stacks provided by the respective platforms (iOS/Android, libcurl/OpenSSL, WebView, etc.) for HTTP(S) requests.
        The security of transport encryption (e.g. TLS/SSL) therefore depends on the libraries used by the platform and on the target servers you choose.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>
        This app is not directed at children under the age of 13 and is designed as a technical test and developer tool.
        We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.
        If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that your child is using the app and has provided personal data,
        you can contact us so that we can review the situation.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in law, technical developments or changes to the app.
        The current version of this privacy policy is always available at the published URL.
        In the event of material changes, we will provide an appropriate notice within the app.
    </p>
    <p>
        The “Last updated” date at the top of this document will be adjusted whenever we make material changes to this privacy policy.
