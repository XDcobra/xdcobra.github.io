    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 10 February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Controller</h2>
    <p>
        The controller responsible for data processing in connection with this app is:<br>
        <strong>Felix Krebs</strong><br>
        Rotweg 38, 71686 Remseck am Neckar<br>
        Email: <a href="mailto:xdcobra11@gmail.com">xdcobra11@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Voice Lab - Offline Tools is an on-device speech toolkit for exploring features such as speech-to-text, text-to-speech,
        voice activity detection, diarization, enhancement, and separation. You can use the app without registration and without
        creating a user account. This privacy policy explains which data is processed when you use the app and for which purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app does not provide an account system or user profiles. We do not assign you a user ID. Third-party advertising SDKs
        may process device identifiers such as the Advertising ID as described below.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data collection and processing</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Data processed locally by the app</h3>
    <p>
        The app processes the following data locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio files or recordings you provide:</strong> Audio is processed on-device for speech tasks such as STT, TTS, VAD, diarization, enhancement, and separation.</li>
        <li><strong>Model files and metadata:</strong> Downloaded model files, checksums, and local manifest data (e.g. download timestamp, last-used timestamp) are stored locally to manage offline use.</li>
        <li><strong>Model settings and app preferences:</strong> Selected models, decoding parameters, and UI preferences are stored locally.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These locally stored data are not accessed by us as the provider and are not transmitted to our own servers.
        We only process personal data if you contact us directly, for example via email.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Advertising via Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>
        This app uses Google AdMob to display ads. For users in the EEA/UK/CH, the service is provided by Google Ireland Limited;
        in other regions, it may be provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Data that may be processed by Google AdMob in particular include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID of your device (e.g. Android Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Device information (device type, operating system version, language settings)</li>
        <li>App usage data (e.g. which ads are shown or clicked)</li>
        <li>Approximate location data (e.g. derived from the IP address), where applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Purposes of processing by AdMob:</strong> Serving and measuring ads, reach measurement, fraud prevention,
        improving the services and, where applicable, serving personalised ads based on your usage and interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data sharing:</strong> The data listed above are transmitted to Google (AdMob) as a third party for advertising,
        measurement, and fraud-prevention purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Where required (in particular for users in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland),
        we obtain your consent before using personalised advertising. In those cases, processing is based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
        In other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in financing and operating the app through advertising (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
        For users in the EEA/UK/CH, consents are obtained in accordance with Google’s EU User Consent Policy via an appropriate consent framework
        (e.g. Google User Messaging Platform / UMP SDK or a compatible Consent Management Platform). If you do not give consent to personalised ads,
        only non-personalised ads are shown or ads are suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Google privacy information:</strong><br>
        Further information on how Google processes data in connection with AdMob can be found at:<br>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a><br>
        Information on how Google uses data from apps and websites that use Google services can be found at:<br>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Opt-out from personalised ads:</strong><br>
        You can disable personalised advertising, for example in the Android settings, such as:<br>
        <em>Settings → Google → Ads → “Opt out of personalised advertising”</em> (labels may differ depending on the Android version).
        You can also reset your advertising ID in your device settings.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Model downloads from GitHub Releases</h3>
    <p>
        The app lets you download speech models directly from the official sherpa-onnx GitHub Releases page. These downloads are
        initiated by you and stored locally on your device so the models can be used offline.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Data that may be processed when downloading models:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Device and network information (e.g. device type, operating system, connection type)</li>
        <li>Download metadata (e.g. file requested, timestamp, size)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To verify integrity, the app may compute cryptographic checksums (SHA-256) of downloaded model files on your device. These
        checksum calculations are performed locally and are not transmitted to our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Downloads are served by GitHub (GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) or its infrastructure
        providers. GitHub may process the data above in accordance with its privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>GitHub privacy information:</strong><br>

        </a>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request the following permissions depending on the features you use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet access:</strong> To fetch resources and serve ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Network status:</strong> To check whether a network connection is available and which type of connection is used.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone / media access (optional):</strong> Only if you choose to record or import audio for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Permissions can be reviewed and revoked in your device settings at any time.
    </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>GitHub (model downloads):</strong> When you download models from the official sherpa-onnx GitHub Releases page,

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legal obligations:</strong> Where we are legally obliged to do so, we may disclose data to authorities or other third parties,
            for example in the context of statutory disclosure obligations.
